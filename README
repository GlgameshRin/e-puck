This files are just a couple of controllers for the E-puck robot. 

I am sharing this because of the lack of examples in Python and mainly for the file e-puck-goal.py and its method updatePosition(). Get the actual position (xz-coordinates + Theta) was explained in a couple of papers and docs online but to get good results it's necessary to extract and merge equations from all over.

In order to use them you must have python installed on your system as well as the Webots software and then:

- Open Webots Software.

- Open one of the worlds for e-puck.

- Copy the files to the controllers/ directory in the project.

- If there is any executable file (e-puck[.exe]) within that dir remove it (or rename it).

- Rename the controller you want to use, Eg. e-puck-wall.py --> e-puck.py

- Run the simulation on webots.

Hope someone can find this useful.
