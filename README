This files are just a couple of controllers for the E-puck robot. 

I am sharing this because of the lack of examples in Python and mainly for the file 
e-puck-goal.py because in it the method updatePosition() is not well explained in 
the documentations and examples and to get the actual position (xz-coordinates + Theta) 
was not so easy following the available docs online. 

Hope someone can find this useful.
